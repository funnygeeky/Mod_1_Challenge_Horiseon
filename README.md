# Mod_1_Challenge_Horiseon
Refactoring the Horiseon webpage for better semantics, accessibility, and SEO.
Using the Chrome Devtools Lighthouse accessibility report and best practices:
1. HTML elements will be updated for better semantics
2. Image elements will include alt attributes unless those images are decorative.
3. Decorative elements will be ignored with an empty alt attribute or given a simplistic description.
4. Ensure the webpage is mobile friendly.
5. Ensure content best practices are followed.
